The defunct band **Emeralds** hold a special place in my listening history. 2007's _[Allegory of Allergies](https://www.discogs.com/Emeralds-Allegory-Of-Allergies/master/69269)_ was a good change of pace from the dark dirge of mid-2000's pedal-worship drone. It wasn't like the queasy maelstrom of noise coming from other droners like **The Skaters**, **Double Leopards** or **Mouthus** (who were all great). Its Frippertronics-style drone hinted at their eventual turn towards a cleaner, ethereal komische-style music. I especially enjoyed the transition as that type of music was fairly new to me. **Cluster** had only recently appeared on my radar. I do recall a friend and regular show-goer at the time wasn't as excited about it, calling it "too [Hearts of Space](https://www.hos.com)".

When the members of Emeralds split, each went on to do their own thing. I've spent time with Mark McGuire's post-Emeralds solo albums, time with releases on **John Elliott's** [Spectrum Spools](http://editionsmego.com/release/SP-004CD) label and lots of time with **Steve Hauschildt's** solo releases. Hauschildt's solo work is reminiscent of the ambience of late Emeralds releases, but 2018's _[Dissolvi](https://stevehauschildt.bandcamp.com/album/dissolvi)_ takes things in a more driving, melodic synth direction and I'm a big fan of it.
